# Aurelia .Net Template
This project has picked up where the official Microsoft Aurelia template left.
It's got more clear webpack configuration and latest Aurelia and Bootstrap packages. Besides it includes [Aurelia-toolbelt](https://github.com/aurelia-toolbelt/aurelia-toolbelt) as the UI library which is on top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).


Those interested in [Materialize](http://materializecss.com) instead of Bootstrap please proceed to [Aurelia .Net Materialize Template](https://github.com/MaximBalaganskiy/AureliaDotnetTemplateMaterialize).
